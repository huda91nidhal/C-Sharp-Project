🍕 Project 23 — Pizza Order Form
First WinForms desktop application — built with C# and .NET Framework as part of Stage Two of the programming roadmap.

🚀 Project Overview
This is the first Windows Forms project in the roadmap.

After completing Stage One (13 courses in C++, Algorithms, OOP, and Data Structures), Stage Two begins with C# and .NET Framework — using desktop development as a structured learning tool.

This project is not just about pizza.

It is about understanding:

How visual controls work
How events connect UI to logic
How state is managed across a form
How clean code principles apply in a GUI environment
The application allows a user to fully customize a pizza order and see the result update in real time — just like a real ordering system.

🏗️ Application Structure
The form is organized into four selection areas and one live summary panel:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Size          Toppings               Order Summary      │
│  ─────         ────────               ─────────────      │
│  Small         Extra Cheese  Onion    Size               │
│  Medium        Mushrooms     Olives   Toppings           │
│  Large         Tomatoes      GreenP   Crust Type         │
│                                       Where To Eat       │
│  Crust Type    Where To Eat           Total Price        │
│  ─────────     ────────────                              │
│  Thin Crust    Eat In                                    │
│  Thick Crust   Take Out                                  │
│                                                          │
│          [ Order Pizza ]   [ Reset Form ]                │

⚙️ Core Functionalities
Feature	Description
Size Selection	Small / Medium / Large — each with its own price
Crust Type	Thin Crust / Thick Crust
Toppings	6 options — any combination, each with its own price
Where To Eat	Eat In / Take Out
Order Summary	Updates in real time on every selection change
Total Price	Recalculated instantly using Tag-based pricing
Order Pizza	Confirmation dialog → disables all controls on confirm
Reset Form	Restores all defaults and re-enables controls
🧠 Key Technical Concepts Practiced
Controls Used
GroupBox — logical grouping of related controls
RadioButton — single-choice selections (Size, Crust, Where To Eat)
CheckBox — multi-choice selections (Toppings)
Label — dynamic display of summary and total price
Button — triggering actions (order and reset)
MessageBox — user confirmation and feedback
Event-Driven Programming
Each control change is connected to an event handler.

The form responds immediately — no submit button is needed to update the summary.

private void rbSmall_CheckedChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) => UpdateSize();
private void chkExtraChees_CheckedChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) => UpdateToppings();
Tag-Based Pricing
Prices are stored directly in the Tag property of each control. No hardcoded price tables. No switch statements.

private float GetSelectedSizePrice()
{
    if (rbSmall.Checked) return Convert.ToSingle(rbSmall.Tag);
    else if (rbMedium.Checked) return Convert.ToSingle(rbMedium.Tag);
    else return Convert.ToSingle(rbLarge.Tag);
}
Clean Code — Divide and Conquer
Each responsibility is isolated in its own method:

UpdateSize()         → reads size, updates label
UpdateCrustType()    → reads crust, updates label
UpdateToppings()     → builds toppings string, updates label
UpdateWhereToEat()   → reads dining option, updates label
UpdateTotalPrice()   → calculates and displays price
UpdateOrderSummary() → calls all update methods together
No single method does more than one thing.

State Management
Ordering: disables all controls — prevents changes after confirming
Resetting: re-enables all controls and restores default selections
🎯 What This Project Teaches
Real-world structure of a WinForms application
Event-driven thinking (react to user actions)
UI state management (enable / disable / reset)
Clean function decomposition inside a GUI project
Connecting visual controls to backend logic
🏁 Course Context
This project is part of:

Course 14 — C# Level 1 Stage Two — Universal Programming Foundations

It is the first project built after switching from C++ to C#, and the first project with a graphical user interface.

The goal at this stage is not to master desktop development.

The goal is to learn how real visual programs work — so that future web, mobile, or backend development becomes easier and clearer.

Desktop is not the destination — it is the training ground.

The roadmap does not just teach programming.

It teaches timing, progression, and how to think correctly at every stage.

🚀 What's Next?
Stage Two continues.

More C# concepts. More WinForms projects. Then databases, backend systems, and larger applications.

The foundation grows stronger with every project.
